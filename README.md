----------
Presently, Honey is my personal playground for experimentation with [dart]
(http://www.dartlang.org/).  As such, I do not have any current plan to make
any releases of the library.  Rather, I intend to spin off any interesting or
useful functionality into other libraries such as [Affinity]
(https://github.com/rmsmith/affinity).  If you find anything of interest here 
that you'd like to see published please let me know so that I am aware.  Thanks!
